# Mono-Develop-Demo-Game

##### This demonstration game that comes to show a simple platfomer/hack'n'slash concept.

##### The player goes through 3 levels, trying to get as many points as possible - points are given for the diamonds picked up and the amount of time saved.
##### For a more details and insight on the game design please see the 2D_Platformer PDF, which also illustrates the concepts with annotated screenshots.
